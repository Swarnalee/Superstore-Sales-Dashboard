# Superstore-Sales-Dashboard
I am excited to share one of my recent projects where I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize sales performance using the Superstore dataset. This end-to-end solution allowed me to apply advanced data modeling, DAX, and visualization techniques to uncover actionable insights for business stakeholders.
📊 Project Highlights:
Developed a visually engaging dashboard that summarizes key performance indicators — Total Sales ($1.57M), Quantity Sold (22K), and Profit (~$175K) — all in real-time.
Used Power Query to clean and transform raw data, and built relationships across tables using a well-structured data model.
Created custom DAX measures for dynamic KPIs like Year-over-Year (YoY) sales/profit trends and segment/category performance.
Built interactive visuals to analyze:
📈 Monthly Sales & Profit trends across 2019–2020.
🧾 Sales by Category/Sub-Category (Office Supplies led with $0.64M).
🧭 Regional performance using map visuals to track sales by state.
💳 Payment Mode Distribution, showing Cards as the most used method (43%).
🚚 Shipping Mode Insights, highlighting Standard Class as the most preferred option.
📍 Key Learning:
 This project strengthened my ability to translate raw data into business insights using Power BI. It also enhanced my skills in data modeling, visual storytelling, and designing user-friendly dashboards that inform strategic decisions.
